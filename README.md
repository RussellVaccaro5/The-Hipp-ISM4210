# The-Hipp-ISM4210

# The Hippodrome (www.thehipp.org) has been providing Gainesville residents with world class live and
cinematic entertainment for the past four decades. Until recently all ticket sales were done using a paper
based system, but a few years ago a web based ticket system was installed using an off-the shelf product
called “TheaterManager” [https://tickets.thehipp.org/TheatreManager/1/online]. * While this system works,
it does not provide a seamless with the rest of the website and has many other limitations. The business
manager wants to bring the website up-to date and allow their patrons to be able to easily purchase tickets
online, manage season passes etc. from their mobile devices using a streamlined interface that reflects the
same aesthetic as the main website.
